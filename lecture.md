# About {-}

This websites contains lectures on statistics and mathematics. All the lectures are made using R programming language inside Rstudio IDE. The presentations were made using the revealjs package. This page was generated using the bookdown package.

# Statistics {- #pres}

## First Paper

### Preliminary Concepts

### Collection, Presentation, and Organization of Data

### Measures of Central Tendency

### Measures of Dispersion

### Moments, Skewness, and Kurtosis

#### Central Moments

Central Moments: $\mu_r=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar x)^r}{n}$

- $\mu_1=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar x)}{n}=\frac{\sum x_i}{n}-\frac{n \bar x}{n}=\frac{n \bar x}{n}-\frac{n \bar x}{n}=0$

- $\mu_2=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar x)^2}{n}=\sigma^2$
- $\mu_3=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar x)^3}{n}$
- $\mu_4=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar x)^4}{n}$
- For grouped data: $\mu_r=\frac{\sum f_i(x_i-\bar x)^3}{n}$


#### Raw Moments

 $\mu_r=\frac{\sum(x_i-a)^r}{n}$; a is arbitrary number

# About me {-}

<img style="float: right; border-radius: 50%;" src="img/mahmud.jpg" width="40%">

I am a **lecturer in statistics** at *Pabna Cadet College*, Pabna, where I joined on 19 October, 2019. Before joining here, I was employed as a research assistant at *EAL*, Dhaka. I also worked as a science contributor for *The Daily Prothom Alo*. 

I have, with the pen name *Abdullah Adil Mahmud (আব্দুল্যাহ আদিল মাহমুদ)*, written **three science books**, which are all available for purchase on [Rokomari.com](https://www.rokomari.com/book/author/47631).

Hailing from Lakshmipur Sadar Upazila, I graduated with **B.S.** and **M.S.** degrees from the **University of Dhaka**.

I founded [Bishwo.com](https://www.bishwo.com) and serve as the editor and contributor of [মহাবিশ্ব](https://sky.bishwo.com) and [Stat Mania](https://www.statmania.info).

I am very passionate about teaching, writing, programming, and data analysis, and I continue doing all of them.

**Learning** is by far my best hobby. In my free time, I love to roam around, connect with people, and watch sky.
