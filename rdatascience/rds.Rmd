#Introduction

This document would complies R commands from basic to advanced level, along with relevant outputs, when required.

In R, assignment operator is usually "<-", although "=" is also usable. 

I divide data science in two broad parts:

i. Getting results
ii. Understanding and Explaining Results

**Assign some value to a variable**

```{r}
x <- 2
x
```

R does not print command to be used explicitly, although _print(x)_, instead of just _x_ in the above would produce the same output.
