# About {-}

This websites contains lectures on statistics and mathematics. These are chiefly meant for being used as reference materials, for finding the techniques and/or formulae easily as you need them. Over the time, however, the topics would be elaborated. 

All the lectures are made using R programming language inside Rstudio IDE. The presentations were made using the revealjs package. This site was generated using the bookdown package.
