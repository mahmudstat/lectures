# Concept of dispersion

## What is Dispersion

## Why?

To

- estimate reliability
- compare variability of several sets of data
- enable further analysis
- have a perception of probability

## Criteria of A Good Measure

- Well-defined
- Easy to understand and compute
- Based on all observations
- Suitable for for further mathematical/statistical analysis
- Less affected by sample fluctuation
- Unaffected by outliers

## Types of Measure

- Absolute
- Relative

## Measure Classification
