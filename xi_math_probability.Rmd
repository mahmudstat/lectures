# Probability

## Important concepts

> - Trial 
> - Experiment 
> - Random experiment
> - Sample space
> - event

# Three Definitions 

## Classical

$P (A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$

## Relative frequency

## Axiomatic

Three axioms

Say, S is sample space and A is an event 

> - $0 \le P (A) \le 1$ <span style="color: red;">(NOT $P(A) \ge 0$)</span>
> - At least one of S will occur. P (S) = 1; Certain event. 
> - $P(A_1 U A_2 U ... U A_n)=P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n)$ or  
> - $$P\left(\cup _{i=1}^{\infty }E_{i}\right)=\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }P(E_{i})$$

## Permutaion vs Combination

There are 15 cricketers in BD preliminary team. We got to <span style="font-style:italic; color:blue;">select </span> 11. C or P? 

> - Where is P used?

# Miscellaneous 

## Misc Problem #01
What is the probability that in a leap year, there are 53 Fridays? 

> - In a leap year, there are 366 days, i.e, 52 weeks and 2 days. In each week is a Fridays, so there are no less than 52 Fridays. The remaining two days could be:
> - (Sat, Sun); (Sun, Mon); (Mon, Tue); (Tue, Wedn); (Wedn, Thu); (Thu, Fri); (Fri, Sat) = 7
> - Total possible outcome = 7 and favorable outcomes = 2
> - $P = \frac{2}{7}$

## Misc Problem #02

Out of the natural numbers 10 through 30, a number is chosen randomly; what is the probability that the number is 

i. a prime number
ii. a prime number or multiple of 5
iii. a prime number or an odd number
iv. not a perfect square

## Misc Problem #02
What is the probability that the product of three positive integers chosen from 1 through 100 is an even number?  

> - Three possible cases
> - All three are even
> - Two odd and one even number
> - Two even and one odd
> - $P=\frac{^{50}C_3}{^{100}C_3}+...$
> - `r round(choose(50,3)/choose(100,3)+2*choose(50,1)*choose(50,2)/choose(100,3),2)`

# Playing Card

## Concepts (Playing Card)

Each rank has 13 cards. 

- Ace (A)
- King (K)
- Queen (Q)
- Jack (J)
- Numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

> - 4+9 numbers = 13 cards. 
</div>

</div>


## Problem #01
3 cards are drawn from a pack of 52 cards. What is the probability that they are all Kings?

There are 4 Kings. We've to draw 3 cards. 

> - $P(K) =\frac{^4C_3}{{^52}C_3}$ 

# Box

## Problems: Type -#
<small>In a box, there are 5 blue marbles, 7 green marbles, and 8 yellow marbles. If two marbles are randomly selected, what is the probability that both will be green or yellow, if taken

i. with replacement

ii. without replacement

</small>

> - Correct or not: $\frac{^7C_2}{^{20}C_2}+\frac{^8C_2}{^{20}C_2}$
> - $\frac{^7C_1 \times ^7C_1}{^{20}C_1 \times ^{20}C_1}+\frac{^8C_1 \times ^8C_1}{^{20}C_1 \times ^{20}C_1}$
> - Without replacement: $\frac{^7C_1 \times ^6C_1}{^{20}C_1 \times ^{20}C_1}+\frac{^8C_1 \times ^7C_1}{^{20}C_1 \times ^{20}C_1}$

# Conditiona Probability

## Conditional Formula

**Bayes Theorem**

$P(B|A)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$

## Problem # 01

Probability that it rains today is 40%, that tomorrow is 50%, and that on both days is 30%. If it rains today, what is the probability that it would rain tomorrow? 

> - $P (T) = 0.4, P(M) = 0.5, P(T\cap M)=0.3, P(M|T)=?$
> - $P(M|T)=\frac{P(T\cap M)}{P(T)}$
> - $\frac{0.3}{0.4}$

Think Why are they so?

- $P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)$, if A & B are independent. 

> - $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$
> - $P(A\cap \bar B)=P(A)-P(A\cap B)$
> - $P(A|\bar B)=\frac{P(A \cap \bar B)}{P(\bar B)}=?$
> - Also recall De Morgan's Laws

## Problem # 01

<small>
The probability of Ronaldo scoring a goal is 0.4 and that of Messi 0.38. What is the probability that-

i. Both Score
ii. Only Ronaldo scores
iii. Only Messi scores?
iv. At least one of them scores
v. Only one of them scores
vi. At most one of them scores
