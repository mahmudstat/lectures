# Simpson's Paradox

Who is better: Sayem or Siyam?  

| Exam        | Sayem           | Siyam  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Exam-1     | $\frac{63}{90} = 70 \%$| $\frac{8}{10}=80 \%$ |
| Exam-2     | $\frac{4}{10} = 40 \%$      |   $\frac{45}{90} = 50 \%$ |

## Look again

Who is really better?  

| Exam        | Sayem           | Siyam  |

| Combined   | $\frac{67}{100} = 67 \%$      |   $\frac{53}{100} = 53 \%$ |

## Batting average

| Year        | Jeter           | Justice  |

## Take a second look

# Problem of Points

- Suppose that two players, A and B, contribute equally to a stake of $60. 
- They agree that the first player who makes 3 points shall win the entire stake. 
- After A has won 2 points, and B has won 1, they agree to stop. 
- How should the stake of 60 dollars be divided? 

> - A = 40 & B = 20?
> - If another match is played
> - If A wins A = 60, B = 0
> - If B wins A = 30, B = 30
> - On average, A = 45, B = 15
