# Intro

- Success/failure
- Detection of a disease is a success!


## Example

The probability of choosing statistics is `r round(8/50,2)`. If 20 students are randomly selected, what is the probability that 

- at least 5 would choose the subject?
- exactly 2 would choose the subject?
- none will choose? 

## Function

$P(x) = ^nC_xp^x(1-p)^{n-x}$

$1-p=q$

> - $p \to$ probability of success
> - $q \to$ probability of failure
> - $n \to$ number of Bernoulli trials
> - $x \to$ no. of success

## Properties of Binomial Distribution

> - Mean: $np$
> - Variance: $npq$
> - Skewness, $\beta_1 = \frac{(q-p)^2}{npq}$
> - Kurtosis, $\beta_2 = 3 + \frac{1-6pq}{npq}$


## Problem 01

The mean and sd of a binomial distribution are 40 and 6. Find 

i) $n,p,q$
ii) $P(x)$
iii) $P(x=0), P(x\ge2), P(x\lt3)$

> - $np = 40$
> - $\sqrt{npq} = 6$
> - $np(1-p)=36 \to 40(1-p)=36 \to 1-p=.9$

## Problem 02

An unbiased coin is tossed 10 times. Find the probability of 

i) 3 heads
ii) at least 2 heads
iii) at most 1 head

## Problem 3

The probability that it rains on a particular day is 0.2. If 10 days are observed, what is the probability that it would rain on

i) all 10 days
ii) no days
iii) at least 2 days
iv) on exactly four days

## Problem 04

In El Clasico, the probability that Barcelona wins is 0.39 and that Real Madrid wins is 0.42. In the next 5 matches, what is the probability that

i) Barcelona wins all the matches?
ii) Real wins all the matches
iii) Barcelona wins at least 2 matches
iv) 2 matches are drawn
v) more than 3 matches are drawn

> - $p_1=$Barca wins, $p_2 =$ Real wins, $p_3 =$Match drawn
