**1. In a college, there are 100 students, of whom 30 play football, 40 play cricket, and 20 play both**

a. What is a sample space?
b. What is the relationship between independence and mutual excluvity? 
b. Are the probabilities of playing cricket and that of football independent? Prove.
c. If a student is selected randomly,a nd if he plays cricket, what is the probability that he does not play football?

**2. There are 9 red and 7 white balls in a box.**

a. If a ball is picked, what is the probability that the ball is not red?
b. If two balls are drawn, what is the probability that both are red?
c. If 6 balls are picked randomly, what is the probability that 3 balls are red and 3 balls are white?
d. When two balls are drawn without replacement, what is probability that none is red? If this task is repeated a hundred times, approximately how many times would we get all-non-red balls?

**3. The probability density function of a continuous random variable is**

$$
  f(x) =
\begin{cases}
kx^2+kx+ \frac 18,  & 0 \le x \le 2 \\
0, & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$
a. What is a random variable?
b. Find the value of k
c. Find the probability that the values of x would lie between 0 and 1.
d. Is $f(x)$ a probability density function? Justify. 

**4. Probability distribution of a random variable is shown on the table:**

|   x  | -3 | -2 | -1 |  0 |  1 |  2  |
|:----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|
| P(x) |  k | 2k | 3k | 2k | 4k | 0.4 |

a. What is the formula of variance in terms of expectation?
b. Prove expected value is equal to arithmetic mean.
c. Find the value of $k$ and $P(X \lt -3 \le0)$.
d. Determine the expected value and variance of X. 

**5. In an industry, 3\% products are found to be defective. A quality control officer collects a sample of 20 items.**

a. What is Bernoulli trial?
b. What is the relationship between Bernoulli and Binomial distribution? 
c. Determine the probability that at least 3 items are defective.
d. Find the probability that no. of defective items would be less than the mean.  

**6. A statistician of a customer care center investigates the calls received and finds that the call center receives 5 calls per hour on average.**

a. What is a Poisson process?
b. When can the Poisson distribution be approximated by the Binomial distribution?
c. What is the probability that no less than three calls would be received?
d. Solve the problem in 3(c) using binomial distribution, assuming any correct combination of values of n and p.
