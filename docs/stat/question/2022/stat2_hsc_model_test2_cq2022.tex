\begin{enumerate}

 \item
	  \textbf{A red and a blue dice are thrown once. The dice are absolutely neutral and independent.} 
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
	What is a simple event? \hfill 1
    \item
	Give an example of a certain event using set theory. \hfill 2
    \item  
	Find the probability that the difference of two digits from two dices is less than 3.\hfill 3
    \item
	Are the probabilities of getting greater digit from the blue die and that from the red die equal? Justify. \hfill 4
  \end{enumerate}

 \item
	  \textbf{A coin is tossed five times. The number of heads appearing from the tosses is considered a discrete random random variable.} 
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
	What is a discrete random variable? \hfill 1
    \item
	Are probability distributions and frequency distributions similar? Show with an example. \hfill 2
    \item  
	Find the probability distribution from the stem and show in a table.\hfill 3
    \item
	Find the probability of number of heads appearing in more than 3 tosses.  \hfill 4
  \end{enumerate}

 \item
	  \textbf{A professor showed a probability distribution in a class:}
\begin{center}	  
	  \begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
x    & 1   & 2 & 3   & 4 & 5   \\
p(x) & 0.1 & a & 0.3 & b & 0.2
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The value of the arithmetic mean of the distribution is 3.
\end{center}	    
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
	What is the formula of expectation? \hfill 1
    \item
	What is the variance of a constant? Explain logically. \hfill 2
    \item  
	What are the values of a \& b? \hfill 3
    \item
	Find and explain the variance of the distribution. \hfill 4
  \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
