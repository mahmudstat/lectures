a. What is a discrete variable?
b. Can fractional numbers be discrete? Explain briefly. 
c. Are, in the stem, $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_i?$ Show statistically.
d. Prove empirically that sum of square is greater than square of sum of numbers. 

**2. We have the data:**

   $f_1=2, f_2 = 4, f_3 = 6$

   $x_1 = -3, x_2 =7, x_3 = 4$

a. What is nominal data?
b. Prove $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i+c)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + nc$
c. Show empirically that $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{3} \sum_{j=1}^{3}(f_i-x_j) \ne \sum_{i=1}^{3} (f_i-x_i)$
d. In which cases are $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_i?$ Show mathematically.

**4. Marks of student of two colleges are:**

|  	| Studnets 	| AM 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| PCC 	| 8 	| 82 	|
| RCC 	| 10 	| 80 	|

where AM = Arithmetic Mean

a. What is change of origin?
b. Does median depend on change of origin? Show mathematically.
c. Determine the combined mean of the students.
