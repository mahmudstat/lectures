a. Moments can be used to find characteristics of a distribution. 
b. Relationship between first raw moment and arithmetic mean.
	
	First raw moment, $\mu_1' = \frac{\Sigma(x_i-a)}{n} = \frac{\Sigma x_i - na}{n} = \bar X - a$
	
	Thus, $\mu_1' = \bar X - a$

c. Second and third central moments from their raw counterparts
	
	Uisng the techniques from [*here*](https://lecture.statmania.info/stat/ch5_xi_stat_moments_skewness_kurtosis.html#/changing-origin-of-moments), 
	We have to use the formulae $a^2+2ab+b^2$ for the 2nd central moment and $a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3$ for the 3rd central moment. 
	
	Here, $b = a - k$ (since we are dealing with central moments, $k=\bar X$
	
	From (b), $\bar X = \mu _1 + a = -1 + 3 = 2$
	
	$\therefore b = 3 - 2 = 1$
	
	\begin{equation} 
	\begin{split}
	\therefore \mu _2 & =\mu _2'(a) + 2 \mu _1'b + b^2\\
	& =5 + 2(-1) \times 1 + 1^2 \\
	& =5-2+1 \\
	& =4
	\end{split}
	(\#eq:cm2)
	\end{equation}
