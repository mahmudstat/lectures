## Sequence

Scatter Plot $\rightarrow$ Correlation $\rightarrow$ Regression

| Scatter Plot                                  | Correlation                  | Regression                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Preliminary idea  about relationship          | Measures linear relationship | Measures Influence                                    |
| Either variable can be  independent (usually) | Does not clarify dependency  | Predicts dependent variable based on independent one. |

## Correlation

Linear relationship between two variables

Corrleation, $r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \bar x)^2}{n}\frac{\sum(y_i - \bar y)^2}{n}}}$

> - $r = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}$

> - $-1 \le r \le 1$

## Scatter Plot And Correlation

![Correlation from Scatter Plot](img/scatter_corr.png)

$r^2=R^2 \rightarrow$ Coefficient of determination

$R^2 = 80% \rightarrow$ 80% of total variation in Y (say, brightness of stars) can be explained by X (say, distance).

## Features of r

> - Independent of origin and scale
> - $-1 \le r \le 1$
> - $r = \sqrt{b_{yx} \cdot b_{xy}}$ (Concerning GM of regression coeff)
> - $\frac{b_{yx}+b_{xy}}{2} \ge r$ (About AM)
> - $r = 0 \rightarrow$ no linear relationship

## Rank Correlation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(10)
rank <- data.frame(Competitor = 1:10,
                   Judge_1 = sample(10:20, 10))
rank$Judge_2 <- sample(8:20, 10)
rank$rank_1 <- rank(-rank$Judge_1)
rank$rank_2 <- rank(-rank$Judge_2)
knitr:: kable(
  head(rank, 10, booktabs = TRUE)
)
```

Coefficient, $\rho = 1- \frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}$
