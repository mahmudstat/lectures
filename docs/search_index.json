These are chiefly meant for being used as reference materials, for finding the techniques and/or formulae easily as you need them. Over the time, however, the topics would be elaborated. They also serve as a means to get a quick overview on statistics and probability. All the lectures are made using R programming language inside Rstudio IDE. The presentations were made using the revealjs package. This site was generated using the bookdown package. You can learn more about me here and about my writings on statistics, data science, and linux here.\n"],
["about-me.html", "About me", " About me I am a lecturer in statistics at Pabna Cadet College, Pabna, where I joined on 19 October, 2019. Before joining here, I was employed as a research assistant at EAL, Dhaka. I also worked as a science contributor for The Daily Prothom Alo. I have, with the pen name Abdullah Adil Mahmud (আব্দুল্যাহ আদিল মাহমুদ), written four science books, which are all available for purchase on Rokomari.com. Hailing from Lakshmipur Sadar Upazila, I graduated with B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Dhaka. I founded Bishwo.com and serve as the editor and contributor of মহাবিশ্ব and Stat Mania. I am very passionate about teaching, writing, programming, and data analysis, and I continue doing all of them. Learning is by far my best hobby. In my free time, I love to roam around, connect with people, and watch sky. Learn more about me at my website (https://www.thinkermahmud.com) "],

If the camera scans a non-terrorist, a bell will not ring 99% of the time, but it will ring 1% of the time. If the bell rings, what is the probability that a terrorist is caught? About 99 of the 100 terrorists will trigger the alarm—and so will about 9,999 of the 999,900 non-terrorists. Therefore, about 10,098 people will trigger the alarm, among which about 99 will be terrorists.

At least one of them scores Only one of them scores At most one of them scores P(R) = 0.4 and P(M) = 0.38 \\(P(R \\cap M)=P(R) \\times P(M)\\) (since independent) \\(P(R \\cap M&#39;)=?\\) \\(P(R&#39; \\cap M)=?\\) \\(P(R \\cup M)\\) \\(P(R \\cap M&#39;)+P(R&#39; \\cap M)\\) Same to 5 2.1.10.3 Set Problem # 02 \\(S_1\\)={1,3,4,7,9,20} \\(S_2\\)={12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18} If a number is randomly chosen from each set, what is the probability that a prime number comes from \\(S_1\\) and a multiple of 3 from \\(S_2\\)? Solution (click to see) Say, P = Prime from \\(S_1\\) M = Multiple of 3 from \\(S_2\\). \\(P(P) = \\frac 3 7\\) and \\(P(M)=\\frac 3 7\\) What do we need to find out? \\(P(P \\cup M)\\) \\(P(P \\cap M)\\) Answer: \\(P(P \\cap M) = P(P) \\cdot P(M)\\) 2.1.10.4 Set Problem # 03 Cup 01 contains 2 black, 3 red, and 1 pink ball. Cup 2 contains only 1 red ball. A cup is selected randomly. Next, a ball is randomly chosen from that randomly selected cup and placed into the other cup. A ball is then drawn randomly from that second cup. Find the probability that the last ball drawn is a pink one. 3 possible cases 1st cup \\(\\rightarrow\\) pink ball \\(\\rightarrow\\) pink ball from 2nd cup 1st cup \\(\\rightarrow\\) non-pink ball \\(\\rightarrow\\) pink ball from 2nd cup 2nd cup \\(\\rightarrow\\) red ball \\(\\rightarrow\\) pink ball from 1st (other) cup \\((\\frac 1 2 \\times \\frac 1 6 \\times \\frac 1 2 )+ (\\frac 1 2 \\times \\frac 5 6 \\times 0) + (\\frac 1 2 \\times 1 \\times \\frac 1 7)\\) 2.1.10.5 Set problem # 04 If a senility researcher discovered that in a population of healthy and diseased elderly people, 14% of the people had senile dementia, 63% had arterioplerotic cerebral degeneration, and 11% had both. What is the probability that a person not having arterioplerotic cerebral degeneration has senile dementia? 2.1.10.6 Set problem # 05 A candidate applied for three posts in an industry, having 3, 4, and 2 candidates respectively. What is the probability of getting a job by that candidate in at least one post? Answer \\(P(F)+P(S)+P(T)-P(F\\cap S)-P(S\\cap T)-P(F\\cap T)+P(F\\cap S \\cap T\\) 2.1.10.7 Set problem # 06 A card is drawn from each of two well-shuffled pack of cards. Find the probability that at least one of them is an ace. Solution(click to see) Let, A = Ace from 1st pack B = Ace from 2nd pack \\(P(A \\cup B)=?\\) \\(P(A) = \\frac{^4C_1}{^{52}C_1}\\) \\(P(B) = P(A)\\) \\(P(A\\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\\) \\(P(A \\cup B)=P(A)+P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\) 2.1.10.8 Set problem # 07 \\(P(A\\cap B)= \\frac 1 3, P(A \\cup B) = \\frac 5 6, and \\space P(A) = \\frac 1 2\\) Find \\(P(B)\\) and \\(P(B^c)\\) 2.1.10.9 Set problem # 08 \\(P(A)= \\frac 1 2, P(B) = \\frac 1 5, \\text{and} \\space P(A|B) = \\frac 3 8\\) Find \\(P(A \\cap B), P(B|A)\\), and \\(P(A \\cup B)\\) See a clue \\(P(B|A) = \\frac {P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}\\) \\(P(A|B) = \\frac {P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\) \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) \\times P(B)\\) \\(\\therefore P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A|B) \\times P(B)}{P(A)}\\) "],
