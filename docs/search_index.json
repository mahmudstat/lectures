["about-me.html", "About me", " About me I am a lecturer in statistics at Pabna Cadet College, Pabna, where I joined on 19 October, 2019. Before joining here, I was employed as a research assistant at EAL, Dhaka. I also worked as a science contributor for The Daily Prothom Alo. I have, with the pen name Abdullah Adil Mahmud (আব্দুল্যাহ আদিল মাহমুদ), written three science books, which are all available for purchase on Rokomari.com. Hailing from Lakshmipur Sadar Upazila, I graduated with B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Dhaka. I founded Bishwo.com and serve as the editor and contributor of মহাবিশ্ব and Stat Mania. I am very passionate about teaching, writing, programming, and data analysis, and I continue doing all of them. Learning is by far my best hobby. In my free time, I love to roam around, connect with people, and watch sky. Learn more about me at my website (https://mahmud.statmania.info) "]
