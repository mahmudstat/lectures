Probability and Statistics Application of Statistics Example Problem 1.1.3 What is statistics? Three Meanings Plural of statistic Table of data Methodology 1.1.4 How Statistics works? Takes a sample from a population. There are many sampling techniques. 1.1.5 Probability and Statistics 1.1.6 Application of Statistics 1.1.7 Examples Identification of unwanted spam messages in e-mail Segmentation of customer behavior for targeted advertising Forecasts of weather behavior and long-term climate changes Prediction of popular election outcomes Development of algorithms for auto-piloting drones and self-driving cars Optimization of energy use in homes and office buildings Projection of areas where criminal activity is most likely Discovery of genetic sequences linked to diseases 1.1.8 Chapter Overview Definition Population and sample Variable and its types Scale of measurement Use of summation sign Main Discussion 1.1.9 Definition Coxton and Crowden Statistics may be defined as the science of collection, presentation, analysis and interpretation of numerical data. 1.1.10 Mechanism Data Collection Organization Analysis Interpretation Presentation 1.1.11 Population and Sample Population: A set of similar items or events which is of interest Sample: Any subset of population Finite Infinite 1.1.12 Variable and Constant Variable Random Variable Constant Examples Income of a regular employee Income of a freelancer Any unchanging number, e.g, \\(\\pi\\) Result of a die throw Father’s name Mark of a subject GPA of a student 1.1.13 Types of Variable Qualitative Quantitative Discrete: Limited and pre-specified Continuous: Can take on any values between any two given number 1.1.14 Univariate, Multivariate 1.1.15 Scale of Measurement Describes nature of information within the values.

["about-me.html", "About me", " About me I am a lecturer in statistics at Pabna Cadet College, Pabna, where I joined on 19 October, 2019. Before joining here, I was employed as a research assistant at EAL, Dhaka. I also worked as a science contributor for The Daily Prothom Alo. I have, with the pen name Abdullah Adil Mahmud (আব্দুল্যাহ আদিল মাহমুদ), written three science books, which are all available for purchase on Rokomari.com. Hailing from Lakshmipur Sadar Upazila, I graduated with B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Dhaka. I founded Bishwo.com and serve as the editor and contributor of মহাবিশ্ব and Stat Mania. I am very passionate about teaching, writing, programming, and data analysis, and I continue doing all of them. Learning is by far my best hobby. In my free time, I love to roam around, connect with people, and watch sky. Learn more about me at my website (https://mahmud.statmania.info) "]
