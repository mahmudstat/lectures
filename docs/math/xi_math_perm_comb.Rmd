## Permutation

In how many ways can we arrange 3 letters A, B, C?

- ABC
- ACB
- BAC
- BCA
- CAB
- CBA

> - That is, 6 ways. In short $3!=3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

## Arranging Subset

In how many ways can we arrange 2 letters from A, B, C?

- AB
- BA
- AC
- CA
- BC
- CB

> - Again 6 ways, but we get it using $^3P_2 = \frac{3!}{(3-2)!}=\frac {6}{1!}=6$

## What is 0!

Why is $3!\ne 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 0$?

## Rule of Counting

## Example

1.a. In how many ways can you select a team of 15 cricketers from a team of 23 cricketers and then from them a final team of 11 cricketers? 

1.b. Afterwards, if you arrange the cricketers in the field, in how many ways can you do the entire process?
