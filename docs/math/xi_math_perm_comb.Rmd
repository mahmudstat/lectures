## Permutation

In how many ways can we arrange 3 letters A, B, C?

- ABC
- ACB
- BAC
- BCA
- CAB
- CBA

> - That is, 6 ways. In short $3!=3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

## Arranging Subset

In how many ways can we arrange 2 letters from A, B, C?

- AB
- BA
- AC
- CA
- BC
- CB

> - Again 6 ways, but we get it using $^3P_2 = \frac{3!}{(3-2)!}=\frac {6}{1!}=6$

## What is 0!

Why is $3!\ne 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 0$?

## Rule of Counting

How the counting rule works? 

```{r crule, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Counting Rule", fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr:: include_graphics("img/counting_rule.png")
```

How many possible routes, from A to B, are there?

## Example

1.a. In how many ways can you select a team of 15 cricketers from a team of 23 cricketers and then from them a final team of 11 cricketers? 

1.b. Afterwards, if you arrange the cricketers in the field, in how many ways can you do the entire process? 

# Exercises

## 2(a)

How many words can be formed using the letters of the word **EQUATION**?

> - Answer = 8! = `r factorial(8)`

## 2(c)

Find the n(arrangements) of the words

i. committee
ii. infinitesimal
iii. proportion

## Extra 01

How many arrangements can be made using the letters from the word COURAGE? What if the arrangements must contain a vowel in the beginning? 

> - $4 \times 6!$

## Extra Problem 02

How many arrangements are possible using the words

- **EYE**
- **CARAVAN**?


## 3(a)

There are (p+q) items, of which p items are homogeneous and q items are heterogeneous. How many arrangements are possible?

## 2(j)

There are 10 letters, of which some are homogeneous while others are heterogeneous. The letters can be arranged in 30240 ways. How many homogeneous letters are there?

Let, $m = \text{number of homogeneous items}$
 
> -  n(arrangements) = 30240 = $\frac {10!}{m!}$
> - $m! = \frac{10!}{30240}=`r factorial(10)/30240`$
> - m = 5

## 2(k)

A library has 8 copies of one book, 3 copies of another two books each, 5 copies of another two books each and single copy of 10 books. In how many ways can they be arranged?

Total books = $1 \times 8+3 \times 2+5 \times 2 + 8 \times 1 + 10$ = `r (a=8+2*3+5*2+8+10)`

> - n(arrangements) = $\frac{`r a`}{8!(3!)^2(5!)^2}$

## 3(a)

How many different arragnements can be made using the letters of the word ENGINEERING? In how many of them do the three E's stand together? In how many do the E's stand first? 

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
<div onclick="klikaj('3a1')"><span>i</span></div>
