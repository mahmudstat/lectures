## Permutation

In how many ways can we arrange 3 letters A, B, C?

- ABC
- ACB
- BAC
- BCA
- CAB
- CBA

> - That is, 6 ways. In short $3!=3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

## Arranging Subset

In how many ways can we arrange 2 letters from A, B, C?

- AB
- BA
- AC
- CA
- BC
- CB

> - Again 6 ways, but we get it using $^3P_2 = \frac{3!}{(3-2)!}=\frac {6}{1!}=6$

## What is 0!

Why is $3!\ne 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 0$?

## Rule of Counting

How the counting rule works? 

```{r crule, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Counting Rule", fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr:: include_graphics("img/counting_rule.png")
```

How many possible routes, from A to B, are there?

## Example

1.a. In how many ways can you select a team of 15 cricketers from a team of 23 cricketers and then from them a final team of 11 cricketers? 

1.b. Afterwards, if you arrange the cricketers in the field, in how many ways can you do the entire process? 

# Exercises

## 1(a)

Find the value of n

$^{n-1}P_3:^{n+1}P_3=5:12$

## 1(b)

Find the value of n

$4 \times ^nP_3 = 5 \times ^{n-1} P_3$


## 1(c)

How many different arrangements can you make by using any 3 items from n different items, without using the general formula and without using an item more than once? What if you can use one item multiple times?
