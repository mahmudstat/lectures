## Permutation

In how many ways can we arrange 3 letters A, B, C?

- ABC
- ACB
- BAC
- BCA
- CAB
- CBA

> - That is, 6 ways. In short $3!=3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

## Arranging Subset

In how many ways can we arrange 2 letters from A, B, C?

- AB
- BA
- AC
- CA
- BC
- CB

> - Again 6 ways, but we get it using $^3P_2 = \frac{3!}{(3-2)!}=\frac {6}{1!}=6$

## What is 0!

Why is $3!\ne 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 0$?

## Rule of Counting

How the counting rule works? 

```{r crule, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Counting Rule", fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr:: include_graphics("img/counting_rule.png")
```

How many possible routes, from A to B, are there?

## Example

1.a. In how many ways can you select a team of 15 cricketers from a team of 23 cricketers and then from them a final team of 11 cricketers? 

1.b. Afterwards, if you arrange the cricketers in the field, in how many ways can you do the entire process? 

# Exercises

## 1(a)

Find the value of n

$^{n-1}P_3:^{n+1}P_3=5:12$

## 1(b)

Find the value of n

$4 \times ^nP_3 = 5 \times ^{n-1} P_3$


## 1(c)

How many different arrangements can you make by using any 3 items from n different items, without using the general formula and without using an item more than once? What if you can use one item multiple times?

## 2(a)

How many words can be formed using the letters of the word **EQUATION**?

> - Answer = 8! = `r factorial(8)`

## 2(c)

Find the n(arrangements) of

i. committee
ii. infinitesimal
iii. proportion

## Extra 01

How many arrangements can be made using the letters from the word COURAGE? What if the arrangements must contain a vowel in the beginning?

## Extra Problem 02

How many arrangements are possible using the words

- **EYE**
- **CARAVAN**?


## 3(a)

There are (p+q) items, of which p items are homogeneous and q items are heterogeneous?

## 2(j)

There are 10 letters, of which some are homogeneous while others are heterogeneous. The letters can be arranged in 30240 ways. How many homogeneous letters are there?

Let, $m = \text{number of heterogeneous items}$
 
> -  n(arrangements) = 30240 = $\frac {10!}{m!}$
> - $m! = \frac{10!}{30240}=`r factorial(10)/30240`$
> - m = 5

## 2(k)

A library has 8 copies of one book, 3 copies of another two books each, 5 copies of another two books each and single copy of 10 books. In how many ways can they be arranged?

Total books = $1 \times 8+2(3 \times 2)+2(5 \times 2) + 8 \times 1$ = `r (a=8+2*3*2+2*5*2+8)`

> - n(arrangements) = $\frac{`r a`}{8!(3!)^2(5!)^2}$

## 2(l)

A man has one white, two red, and three green flags; how many different signals can he produce, each containing five flags and one above another?

Flags: W = 2, R = 2, G = 3, Total = 7

> - $\frac{^7P_5}{2!3!}$=`r choose(7,5)/(factorial(3)*factorial(2))`
