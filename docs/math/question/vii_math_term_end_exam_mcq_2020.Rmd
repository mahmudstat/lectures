**Creative Questions**

Three friends Saleh, Tahmid, and Rasel collect 10710 tk. for a program. Rasel gives half of Saleh's amount, while Tahmid gives $\frac 5 3$ part of Rasel. 

a. $\space$ Determine the simple ratio of their amount.
c. $\space$ How many tk. did Rasel and Tahmid contribute?
d. $\space$ If 10,010 tk. is spent for the program, how much amount would each of them get back?

**Solution**

a. Ratio:  $Saleh:Tahmid:Rasel = 1:\frac 5 6 : \frac 1 2$

$\qquad$ Simple Ratio: $3:5:6$ (multiplying by 6)

b. $3+5+6 = 14$

$\qquad$ Rasel's amount = `r 3/14*10710`

$\qquad$ Tahmid's amount = `r 5/14*10710`

$\qquad$ Saleh's amount = `r 6/14*10710`

c. Remaining amount = `r (rem = 10710-10010)`

$\qquad$ Rasel would get back = `r 3/14*rem`

$\qquad$ Tahmid would get back = `r 5/14*rem`

$\qquad$ Saleh would get back = `r 6/14*rem`
