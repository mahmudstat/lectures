# About {-}

This websites contains lectures on statistics and mathematics. These are chiefly meant for being used as reference materials, for finding the techniques and/or formulae easily as you need them. Over the time, however, the topics would be elaborated. They also serve as a means to get a quick overview on statistics and probability. 

- See the lecture presentations [here](#pres)  

All the lectures are made using R programming language inside Rstudio IDE. The presentations were made using the revealjs package. This site was generated using the bookdown package.

## About me {-}

<img style="float: right; border-radius: 50%;" src="img/mahmud.jpg" width="40%">

I am a **lecturer in statistics** at *Pabna Cadet College*, Pabna, where I joined on 19 October, 2019. Before joining here, I was employed as a research assistant at *EAL*, Dhaka. I also worked as a science contributor for *The Daily Prothom Alo*. 

I have, with the pen name *Abdullah Adil Mahmud (আব্দুল্যাহ আদিল মাহমুদ)*, written **four science books**, which are all available for purchase on [Rokomari.com](https://www.rokomari.com/book/author/47631).

Hailing from Lakshmipur Sadar Upazila, I graduated with **B.S.** and **M.S.** degrees from the **University of Dhaka**.

I founded [Bishwo.com](https://www.bishwo.com) and serve as the editor and contributor of [মহাবিশ্ব](https://sky.bishwo.com) and [Stat Mania](https://www.statmania.info).

I am very passionate about teaching, writing, programming, and data analysis, and I continue doing all of them.

**Learning** is by far my best hobby. In my free time, I love to roam around, connect with people, and watch sky.
